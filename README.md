# Frontend Template for Websites

## Project Details

This is a Vite project configured to use TypeScript and React. It provides a ready-to-use foundation for creating any frontend interface you need for a browser.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to offer a template for frontend development that helps you get started quickly. The site is organized into the following sections:

- **Navbar pane**
- **Main pane**
- **Footer pane**

Each pane in this template is part of a vertical layout. You can also add horizontal panes or additional vertical sections with careful consideration of the heights. The panes are fixed in size using viewport units (vh/vw). For specific details about the sizing, refer to the `App.css` file.

This template will be maintained and updated to reflect the latest best practices and updates.

## Deployment

The project includes a Docker folder with Dockerfiles, a docker-compose file, and a Makefile.

> **Tip:** Use Makefiles to simplify your scripts. You can even use the Makefile for straightforward Docker deployments.

You can either use the Makefile to run the project locally or to deploy it within a Docker container. The Makefile simplifies project management and deployment significantly.

Please update these files to meet your needs. I have incorporated basic configurations and scripts to help you get started.
